### Install Dependencies

`npm` is preconfigured to automatically copy the downloaded AngularJS files to `app/lib` so we
can simply do:

```
npm install
```

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/lib` - contains the AngularJS framework files and other front end dependencies

### Run the Application

Start server using:

```
npm start
```

Browse to the app at localhost:8000
